# Copy_paste_with_banlist
Copy past script that lets you choose file or folder names you wanna exclude from your copy paste, works best if you got a bunch of folders with similar structure and repetitive files or folder you want to exclude, i made this for my particular use case when I needed to back up some folders and wanted to automate it
